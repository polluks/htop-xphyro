Introduction
------------

This is `htop`, an interactive process viewer.
It requires `ncurses`. It is developed primarily on Linux,
but we also have code for running under FreeBSD and Mac OS X
(help and testing are wanted for these platforms!)

This software has evolved considerably over the years,
and is reasonably complete, but there is always room for improvement.

Comparison between `htop` and classic `top`
-------------------------------------------

* In `htop` you can scroll the list vertically and horizontally
  to see all processes and full command lines.
* In `top` you are subject to a delay for each unassigned
  key you press (especially annoying when multi-key escape
  sequences are triggered by accident).
* `htop` starts faster (`top` seems to collect data for a while
  before displaying anything).
* In `htop` you don't need to type the process number to
  kill a process, in `top` you do.
* In `htop` you don't need to type the process number or
  the priority value to renice a process, in `top` you do.
* In `htop` you can kill multiple processes at once.
* `top` is older, hence, more tested.

Compilation instructions
